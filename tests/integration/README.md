## Package: integration_test

This package contains integration tests for the LocalAI component.

### Imports:

### External Data and Input Sources:

- The tests use a temporary directory to store the backend assets.
- The tests use a mock store backend to simulate the behavior of the actual backend.

### TODOs:

- None found.

### Summary:

The package contains integration tests for the stores backend(s) and internal APIs. The tests cover various aspects of the backend, including setting and getting keys, deleting keys, finding similar keys, and ensuring the triangle inequality holds for normalized values. The tests use a temporary directory to store the backend assets and a mock store backend to simulate the behavior of the actual backend.

### Code Structure:

The package consists of two main test files:

- integration_suite_test.go: This file contains the main test suite for the LocalAI component. It is executed using the Ginkgo testing framework and the Gomega assertion library. The test suite is configured to output logs to the console using the zerolog logging library.
- stores_test.go: This file contains integration tests for the stores backend(s) and internal APIs.

### Relations between Code Entities:

The tests in the package rely on the LocalAI component's internal APIs and backend(s). They use a mock store backend to simulate the behavior of the actual backend and a temporary directory to store the backend assets.

### Unclear Places:

None found.

### Dead Code:

None found.

### Edge Cases:

The tests can be launched by running the `go test` command in the integration_test package directory.

### Configuration:

None found.
