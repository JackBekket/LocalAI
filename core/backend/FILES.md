### ModelEmbedding function  
This function takes a string, a slice of integers, a ModelLoader, a BackendConfig, and an ApplicationConfig as input. It loads a model using the ModelLoader and then uses a switch statement to determine the type of the loaded model. If the model is a grpc.Backend, it calls the Embeddings function of the model with the provided string or tokens. If the model is not a grpc.Backend, it returns an error. The function returns a function that returns the embeddings and an error.  
  
### Embedding processing  
The returned function from ModelEmbedding then processes the embeddings by removing trailing 0s and returns the processed embeddings and an error.  
  
### Summary  
The backend package provides a function to load a model and generate embeddings for a given input string or tokens. It supports different backend types and handles the processing of the generated embeddings.
