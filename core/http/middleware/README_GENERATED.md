## Package: middleware

This package contains middleware functions for handling requests and extracting information from them.

### External Data and Input Sources:

- The code relies on the `context` package for managing request context and cancellation.
- It uses the `fiber/v2` package for handling HTTP requests and responses.
- It interacts with the `config` package to load backend configuration files.
- It uses the `model` package to load and manage models.
- It leverages the `schema` package to define data structures for localAI requests.
- It depends on the `services` package for interacting with backend services.
- It utilizes the `functions` package to handle function calls.
- It employs the `templates` package for templating content.
- It uses the `utils` package for various utility functions.

### TODOs:

- Refactor `setModelNameFromRequest` to not return an error if unchanged.
- If context and cancel above belong on all methods, move that part of `SetModelAndConfig` into `SetModelAndConfig`. Otherwise, it's in its own method below for now.

### Major Code Parts:

1. **Request Extractor:**
   - The `RequestExtractor` struct is responsible for extracting information from incoming requests and setting up the necessary context for processing.
   - It includes methods for setting the model name, setting the OpenAI request, and building middleware handlers for default model selection and filtering.

2. **Model Name Handling:**
   - The `setModelNameFromRequest` method extracts the model name from the request parameters, query string, or authorization header.
   - The `BuildConstantDefaultModelNameMiddleware` and `BuildFilteredFirstAvailableDefaultModelName` methods provide middleware handlers for setting default model names.

3. **Context and Configuration Setup:**
   - The `SetModelAndConfig` method sets the model name and configuration in the request context.
   - The `SetOpenAIRequest` method sets the OpenAI request and backend configuration in the request context.

4. **OpenAI Request Handling:**
   - The `mergeOpenAIRequestAndBackendConfig` function merges the OpenAI request and backend configuration, handling various parameters and settings.

5. **Utility Functions:**
   - The code includes utility functions for handling correlation IDs, setting up request context, and merging request data with backend configuration.

### File Structure:

- auth.go
- request.go
- strippathprefix.go
- strippathprefix_test.go

### Relations between Code Entities:

- The `auth.go` file contains the configuration generators and handler functions that are used along with the fiber/keyauth middleware. It provides functions to handle API key validation, error handling, and filtering.
- The `request.go` file contains the middleware functions for handling requests and extracting information from them.
- The `strippathprefix.go` file contains the middleware function that strips a path prefix from the request path.
- The `strippathprefix_test.go` file contains the unit tests for the `strippathprefix.go` file.

### Unclear Places:

- The code does not explicitly mention how the middleware functions are registered and used in the application.
- It is unclear how the configuration settings from the config package are accessed and used by the middleware functions.

### Dead Code:

- There is no dead code identified in the provided files.
