# core/schema/elevenlabs.go  
Package: schema  
  
Imports:  
- "encoding/json"  
- "gopkg.in/yaml.v2"  
  
External data, input sources:  
- Text input for text-to-speech conversion  
- Model ID for selecting a specific voice model  
- Language code for specifying the target language  
  
TODOs:

Summary:  
- The schema package defines data structures for ElevenLabs TTS and sound generation requests.  
- The ElevenLabsTTSRequest struct contains the text to be converted to speech, the model ID, and the language code.  
- The ElevenLabsSoundGenerationRequest struct contains the text, model ID, duration, temperature, and doSample parameters for sound generation.  
- Both structs have a ModelName method that allows setting or retrieving the model ID.  
  
  
  
# core/schema/jina.go  
Package/Component name: schema  
  
Imports:  
- No imports  
  
External data, input sources:  
- No external data or input sources are explicitly mentioned in the code. However, the code defines data structures for handling requests and responses related to reranking documents.  
  
TODOs:  
- No TODO comments found in the code.  
  
Summary of major code parts:  
- The code defines several data structures for handling reranking requests and responses.  
- JINARerankRequest: Represents the request payload for reranking documents. It includes the query, documents to be reranked, the desired number of top results, and the backend to use.  
- JINADocumentResult: Represents a single document result, including its index, text, and relevance score.  
- JINAText: Holds the text of a document.  
- JINARerankResponse: Represents the response payload for reranking documents. It includes the model used, usage information, and the reranked results.  
- JINAUsageInfo: Holds information about the usage of tokens during the reranking process.  
  
  
  
# core/schema/localai.go  
Package: schema  
  
Imports:  
- github.com/mudler/LocalAI/core/p2p  
- github.com/shirou/gopsutil/v3/process  
  
External data, input sources:  
- The code interacts with the p2p package to retrieve information about nodes and federated nodes.  
- It uses the gopsutil package to access system information, such as memory and CPU usage.  
  
TODOs:  
- There are no TODO comments in the provided code.  
  
Summary:  
- The schema package defines various data structures used for communication between different components of the LocalAI system.  
- It includes types for requests and responses related to backend monitoring, token metrics, text-to-speech (TTS), voice activity detection (VAD), and system information.  
- The package also defines data structures for managing key-value stores, such as adding, deleting, retrieving, and finding entries.  
- The P2PNodesResponse type provides information about nodes and federated nodes in the p2p network.  
- The SystemInformationResponse type contains details about available backends and loaded models.

# core/schema/prediction.go  
Package/Component name: schema  
  
Imports:  
- "gopkg.in/yaml.v2"  
- "encoding/json"  
  
External data, input sources:  
- The code uses the "gopkg.in/yaml.v2" package to handle YAML data.  
- It also uses the "encoding/json" package to handle JSON data.  
  
TODOs:  
- There are no TODO comments in the provided code.  
  
Summary of major code parts:  
- The code defines a struct called PredictionOptions, which is used to store various options for making predictions.  
- The struct contains fields for basic model request, language, translation, number of results, top probability, top k, temperature, maximum tokens, echo, batch size, ignore end of sequence, repeat penalty, repeat last n, keep, frequency penalty, presence penalty, typical probability, seed, negative prompt, rope frequency base, rope frequency scale, negative prompt scale, clip skip, and tokenizer.  
- These options are used to configure the behavior of the prediction process, such as the model to use, the language to generate text in, and the number of results to return.  
  
  
  
# core/schema/request.go  
Package: schema  
  
Imports:  
- "context"  
  
External data, input sources:  
- The code defines a generic request to LocalAI, which is a system for interacting with local AI models.  
  
TODOs:  
- Should BasicModelRequest include the following fields from the OpenAI side of the world?  
    - Context context.Context  
    - Cancel context.CancelFunc  
    - If so, changes should be made to core/http/middleware/request.go to match  
  
Summary:  
- The code defines a generic request to LocalAI, which is a system for interacting with local AI models.  
- The LocalAIRequest interface is used to represent any request to LocalAI.  
- The BasicModelRequest struct is a concrete implementation of the LocalAIRequest interface.  
- The ModelName method of the BasicModelRequest struct returns the model name.  
  
  
  
# core/schema/tokenize.go  
Package: schema  
  
Imports:  
- json  
  
External data, input sources:  
- Content string in TokenizeRequest  
  
TODOs:  
- None  
  
Summary:  
- The schema package defines the data structures for tokenization requests and responses.  
- TokenizeRequest contains the content to be tokenized and inherits from BasicModelRequest.  
- TokenizeResponse contains the list of tokens generated from the input content.  
  
# core/schema/transcription.go  
Package/Component name: schema  
  
Imports:  
time  
  
External data, input sources:  
- None  
  
TODOs:  
- None  
  
Summary:  
The schema package defines two structs: TranscriptionSegment and TranscriptionResult. TranscriptionSegment represents a segment of transcribed audio, containing its ID, start and end times, text, and a list of token IDs. TranscriptionResult contains a list of TranscriptionSegments and the full transcribed text. These structs are likely used for storing and exchanging transcription data in a JSON format.
