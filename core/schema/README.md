# schema

This package defines data structures for various AI-related tasks, including text-to-speech (TTS), sound generation, reranking documents, and tokenization.

## File structure:

- core/schema/elevenlabs.go
- core/schema/jina.go
- core/schema/localai.go
- core/schema/openai.go
- core/schema/prediction.go
- core/schema/request.go
- core/schema/tokenize.go
- core/schema/transcription.go

## Code summary:

The package contains several structs and interfaces for handling requests and responses related to different AI tasks.

- ElevenLabsTTSRequest and ElevenLabsSoundGenerationRequest: These structs are used for handling text-to-speech and sound generation requests for ElevenLabs. They contain the text to be converted, the model ID, and other parameters.
- JINARerankRequest, JINADocumentResult, JINAText, JINARerankResponse, and JINAUsageInfo: These structs are used for handling reranking requests and responses for JINA. They include information about the query, documents, and reranking results.
- LocalAIRequest and BasicModelRequest: These structs are used for handling requests to LocalAI, a system for interacting with local AI models.
- PredictionOptions: This struct is used for storing various options for making predictions, such as the model to use, the language to generate text in, and the number of results to return.
- TokenizeRequest and TokenizeResponse: These structs are used for handling tokenization requests and responses. They contain the content to be tokenized and the list of tokens generated.
- TranscriptionSegment and TranscriptionResult: These structs are used for storing and exchanging transcription data. They contain information about the transcribed audio, such as the start and end times, text, and token IDs.

## Relations between code entities:

The structs and interfaces are related to each other through inheritance and composition. For example, the ElevenLabsTTSRequest and ElevenLabsSoundGenerationRequest structs inherit from the BasicModelRequest interface.

## Unclear places:

None.

## Dead code:

None.
