Summary:  
The `cli` package provides the command-line interface for the LocalAI application. It defines a structure named `CLI` that embeds a `Context` from the `cli/context` package and includes various subcommands for managing models, running the application in federated mode, converting text to speech, generating audio, converting audio to text, running workers, providing utility commands, and running a p2p explorer.  
  
- RunCMD: This subcommand is responsible for running the LocalAI application. It is the default command if no other command is specified.  
- FederatedCLI: This subcommand allows users to run LocalAI in federated mode.  
- ModelsCMD: This subcommand enables users to manage LocalAI models and definitions.  
- TTSCMD: This subcommand converts text to speech.  
- SoundGenerationCMD: This subcommand generates audio files from text or audio input.  
- TranscriptCMD: This subcommand converts audio to text.  
- Worker: This subcommand runs workers to distribute workload, specifically for llama.cpp-only deployments.  
- UtilCMD: This subcommand provides utility commands for various tasks.  
- ExplorerCMD: This subcommand runs a p2p explorer for the LocalAI application.  
  
By embedding the `Context` from the `cli/context` package, the `CLI` structure provides access to shared data and functionality across all subcommands. The `cmd` tag on each subcommand indicates that it is a valid command-line option.

Summary:  
The code defines a TTSCMD struct that handles text-to-speech (TTS) functionality. It takes text input, model name, voice, language, and output file path as command-line arguments. The struct also handles the configuration of the backend, model path, and assets destination. The Run method of the struct performs the TTS process by using the provided input and configuration to generate a WAV file. The output file can be either specified by the user or automatically generated.  
  
The code also includes a model loader that is responsible for loading and managing the TTS model. The model loader is initialized with the model path and backend configuration. The model loader is used to perform the TTS process by calling the backend's ModelTTS function. The ModelTTS function takes the text input, voice, language, model loader, and backend configuration as arguments and returns the path to the generated WAV file.  
  
After the TTS process is complete, the code handles the output file. If the user specified an output file path, the generated WAV file is renamed to the specified path. Otherwise, the generated WAV file is printed to the console.  
  
In summary, the code provides a command-line interface for performing TTS tasks, including loading and managing the TTS model, handling user input, and generating the output WAV file.
