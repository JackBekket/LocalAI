## Package: application

This package is responsible for initializing and managing the LocalAI application. It handles loading models, configuring backends, and starting the application.

### External Data and Input Sources:

1. Configuration files: The application reads configuration files to determine settings and options.
2. Model files: The application loads model files to enable various functionalities.
3. User input: The application interacts with users to receive commands and requests.

### TODOs:

1. Implement a mechanism to handle dynamic configuration updates.
2. Add support for loading models from external sources.
3. Improve error handling and logging.

### Code Summary:

1. **Initialization:** The `New` function initializes the application with the given options and performs necessary setup tasks. It creates directories, loads models, and configures backends.
2. **Model Loading:** The application loads models from various sources, including local files, remote URLs, and embedded assets. It also handles model updates and upgrades.
3. **Backend Configuration:** The application configures backends based on the provided options and settings. It loads backend configurations, sets up communication channels, and manages resources.
4. **Configuration Handling:** The application monitors configuration files for changes and updates the application accordingly. It also handles dynamic configuration updates.
5. **Watchdog:** The application includes a watchdog mechanism to monitor the health of backends and restart them if necessary.
6. **Resource Management:** The application manages resources such as memory, CPU, and GPU usage. It allocates and releases resources as needed to ensure optimal performance.
7. **Logging and Monitoring:** The application logs events, errors, and warnings to help with debugging and troubleshooting. It also provides monitoring tools to track application performance and resource usage.

This package is crucial for the proper functioning of the LocalAI application. It ensures that the application is properly configured, models are loaded, and backends are running smoothly. The package also handles dynamic configuration updates and resource management to maintain optimal performance.

### Project Package Structure:

- application.go
- config_file_watcher.go
- startup.go
- core/application/application.go
- core/application/config_file_watcher.go
- core/application/startup.go

### Relations between Code Entities:

The `application` package relies on the `config` package to load backend configuration and the `model` package to load models. It also uses the `templates` package to evaluate templates. The `config_file_watcher` package is responsible for monitoring configuration files and updating the application accordingly. The `startup` package handles the initialization and management of the application.

### Unclear Places:

- The code does not explicitly mention how the application handles dynamic configuration updates.
- It is unclear how the application manages resources such as memory, CPU, and GPU usage.

### Dead Code:

- None found.
