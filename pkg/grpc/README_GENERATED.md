# grpc

This package provides a client and server implementation for interacting with a gRPC server. It includes functions for health checks, embeddings, predictions, loading models, and various other operations.

## Package Structure

- `backend.go`: Defines the Backend interface and provides functions for interacting with the gRPC server.
- `base/base.go`: Contains base functionalities for the package.
- `base/singlethread.go`: Implements single-threaded functionalities.
- `client.go`: Provides a client for interacting with the gRPC server.
- `embed.go`: Implements embedding functionalities.
- `interface.go`: Defines the LLM interface for interacting with the Large Language Model.
- `server.go`: Implements the gRPC server.

## External Data and Input Sources

The client and server interact with a gRPC server, which is assumed to be running and accessible. The server's address is provided as a parameter to the client's constructor.

## Summary of Major Code Parts

1. **Client:** The Client struct is the main component of the package. It handles all communication with the gRPC server and provides methods for various operations.

2. **Health Check:** The HealthCheck function checks the health of the server by sending a health request and receiving a response.

3. **Embeddings:** The Embeddings function sends a PredictOptions object to the server and receives an EmbeddingResult object in response.

4. **Prediction:** The Predict function sends a PredictOptions object to the server and receives a Reply object in response.

5. **Load Model:** The LoadModel function sends a ModelOptions object to the server and receives a Result object in response.

6.0 Prediction Stream: The PredictStream function sends a PredictOptions object to the server and receives a stream of Reply objects in response.

7. **Generate Image:** The GenerateImage function sends a GenerateImageRequest object to the server and receives a Result object in response.

8. **TTS:** The TTS function sends a TTSRequest object to the server and receives a Result object in response.

9. **Sound Generation:** The SoundGeneration function sends a SoundGenerationRequest object to the server and receives a Result object in response.

10. **Audio Transcription:** The AudioTranscription function sends a TranscriptRequest object to the server and receives a TranscriptResult object in response.

11. **Tokenize String:** The TokenizeString function sends a PredictOptions object to the server and receives a TokenizationResponse object in response.

12. **Status:** The Status function sends a HealthMessage object to the server and receives a StatusResponse object in response.

13. **Stores Set:** The StoresSet function sends a StoresSetOptions object to the server and receives a Result object in response.

14. **Stores Delete:** The StoresDelete function sends a StoresDeleteOptions object to the server and receives a Result object in response.

15. **Stores Get:** The StoresGet function sends a StoresGetOptions object to the server and receives a StoresGetResult object in response.

16. **Stores Find:** The StoresFind function sends a StoresFindOptions object to the server and receives a StoresFindResult object in response.

17. **Rerank:** The Rerank function sends a RerankRequest object to the server and receives a RerankResult object in response.

18. **Get Token Metrics:** The GetTokenMetrics function sends a MetricsRequest object to the server and receives a MetricsResponse object in response.

19. **VAD:** The VAD function sends a VADRequest object to the server and receives a VADResponse object in response.

## Conclusion

The grpc package provides a comprehensive set of functions for interacting with a gRPC server, enabling users to perform various operations such as health checks, embeddings, predictions, and more.
