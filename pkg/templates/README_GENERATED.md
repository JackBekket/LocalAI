# templates_test

This package contains tests for the templates module. It defines three templates: toolCallJinja, chatML, and llama3. The package includes test cases for each template, covering various scenarios such as user, assistant, function call, and function response messages. The tests use the Evaluator to template the messages and assert that the output matches the expected result. The package is part of the LocalAI project, which provides a platform for building and deploying AI agents.
