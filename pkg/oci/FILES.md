Package name: oci_test  
  
Imports:  
- "os"  
- "github.com/mudler/LocalAI/pkg/oci"  
- "github.com/onsi/ginkgo/v2"  
- "github.com/onsi/gomega"  
  
External data, input sources:  
- The code uses the "registry.ollama.ai/library/gemma" image as input for testing.  
  
TODOs:  
- There are no TODO comments in the code.  
  
Summary:  
The oci_test package contains tests for the OCI (Open Container Initiative) module. The provided code tests the FetchImageBlob function, which is responsible for fetching blobs from a given image. The test creates a temporary file and then uses the FetchImageBlob function to fetch the blob from the "registry.ollama.ai/library/gemma" image. The test then checks if the function returns an error and if the file is successfully created.

Imports:  
- "os"  
- "runtime"  
- "github.com/mudler/LocalAI/pkg/oci"  
- "github.com/onsi/ginkgo/v2"  
- "github.com/onsi/gomega"  
  
External data, input sources:  
- The code uses the "github.com/mudler/LocalAI/pkg/oci" package to interact with OCI images.  
- It relies on the "github.com/onsi/ginkgo/v2" and "github.com/onsi/gomega" packages for testing purposes.  
  
TODOs:  
- None found.  
  
### Summary of major code parts:  
  
This file contains a test suite for the OCI package. It covers the following aspects:  
- Loading an OCI image template successfully.  
- Evaluating the template correctly.  
- Extracting the OCI image to a temporary directory.  
  
The test suite uses the Ginkgo testing framework and the Gomega assertion library. It first checks if the test is running on a Darwin system, and if so, skips the test. Then, it retrieves an OCI image with the specified name, checks its size, and extracts the image to a temporary directory. Finally, it asserts that the extraction process was successful.  
  
The test suite demonstrates the functionality of the OCI package by loading, evaluating, and extracting OCI images. It ensures that the package works as expected and provides a comprehensive test coverage for the core functionalities.

Summary:  
The `oci_test` package contains a single function, `TestOCI`, which is responsible for running the OCI test suite. It registers a fail handler and runs the specs using the Ginkgo testing framework.  
  
  
  
# pkg/oci/ollama_test.go  
Package: oci_test  
  
Imports:  
- "os"  
- "github.com/mudler/LocalAI/pkg/oci"  
- "github.com/onsi/ginkgo/v2"  
- "github.com/onsi/gomega"  
  
External data, input sources:  
- The code uses the OllamaFetchModel function to pull model files from a remote source. The specific model being pulled is "gemma:2b".  
  
TODOs:  
- There are no TODO comments in the provided code.  
  
Summary:  
The oci_test package contains tests for the OCI (Open Container Initiative) module. The provided code specifically tests the OllamaFetchModel function, which is responsible for pulling model files from a remote source. The test creates a temporary file and uses the OllamaFetchModel function to download the "gemma:2b" model to the file. The test then asserts that the download was successful and that no errors occurred during the process.
