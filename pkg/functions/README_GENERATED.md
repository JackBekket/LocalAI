# functions

This package provides functionality for handling function structures, grammars, and parsing function call results.

## Functionality

The package defines several key components:

1. Function Structure:
   - The `Item` struct represents an item in the JSON function structure, containing its type and properties.
   - The `JSONFunctionStructure` struct represents the overall structure of a JSON function, including its OneOf, AnyOf, and Defs fields.
   - The `Grammar()` function converts a JSONFunctionStructure to a grammar string.

2. Grammar Handling:
   - The `SchemaConverter` interface defines a method for converting data to a grammar string.
   - The `NewSchemaConverter()` function creates a SchemaConverter based on the provided options.

3. Function Parsing:
   - The `Functions` type represents a list of functions.
   - The `ToJSONStructure()` method converts a list of functions to a JSON structure.
   - The `Select()` method returns a list of functions containing the function with the given name.

4. JSON Mode:
   - The `JSONBNF` constant contains the grammar for JSON in Backus-Naur Form (BNF).

5. Parsing Function Call Results:
   - The `GrammarConfig` struct defines the configuration for the grammar.
   - The `FunctionsConfig` struct includes the grammar configuration and additional settings for handling function call results.
   - The `GrammarOptions()` function returns a list of grammar options based on the provided configuration.
   - The `ParseTextContent()`, `ParseJSON()`, `ParseFunctionCall()`, and `ParseFunctionCallArgs()` functions handle parsing function call results from the LLM response.
   - The `CleanupLLMResult()` function cleans up the LLM response.

## Relations

The package's components work together to provide a comprehensive solution for handling function structures, grammars, and parsing function call results. The `functions` package defines the function structure and parsing logic, while the `grammars` package handles grammar-related tasks.

## Unclear Places

The provided code does not mention how the grammar configurations are loaded or updated. It also does not specify how the parsed function call results are used or integrated into the application.

## Dead Code

There is no dead code in the provided code.

## Summary

The `functions` package provides a robust set of tools for handling function structures, grammars, and parsing function call results. It enables applications to work with functions in a structured and efficient manner, making it suitable for various use cases.
