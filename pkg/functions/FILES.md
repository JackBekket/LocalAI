# pkg/functions/function_structure.go  
Package: functions  
  
Imports:  
- "encoding/json"  
- "github.com/mudler/LocalAI/pkg/functions/grammars"  
  
External data, input sources:  
- JSONFunctionStructure: This struct is used to represent the structure of a JSON function. It contains three fields: OneOf, AnyOf, and Defs. These fields are used to define the possible types and properties of the function's input and output.  
  
TODOs:  
- There are no TODO comments in the provided code.  
  
Summary of major code parts:  
- Item struct: This struct represents an item in the JSON function structure. It has two fields: Type and Properties. Type is a string that specifies the type of the item, and Properties is a map of string keys to interface{} values that specifies the properties of the item.  
- JSONFunctionStructure struct: This struct represents the overall structure of a JSON function. It contains three fields: OneOf, AnyOf, and Defs. OneOf and AnyOf are slices of Item structs, and Defs is a map of string keys to interface{} values.  
- Grammar() function: This function takes a JSONFunctionStructure struct as input and returns a string representation of the function's grammar. It first converts the JSONFunctionStructure struct to JSON format, then uses a SchemaConverter to generate the grammar string.  
- SchemaConverter interface: This interface defines a method called GrammarFromBytes() that takes a byte slice and a variable number of GrammarOption structs as input and returns a string representation of the grammar and an error.  
- NewSchemaConverter() function: This function takes a GrammarOption struct as input and returns a SchemaConverter. It checks the SchemaType field of the GrammarOption struct and returns the appropriate SchemaConverter implementation.  
  
  
  
# pkg/functions/functions.go  
Package: functions  
  
Imports:  
- "encoding/json"  
- "github.com/rs/zerolog/log"  
  
External data, input sources:  
- The code uses JSON data structures to represent functions, their parameters, and arguments.  
  
TODOs:  
- There are no TODO comments in the provided code.  
  
Summary:  
- The code defines a Function struct to represent a function with its name, description, strictness, and parameters.  
- It also defines a Functions type as a slice of Function structs.  
- The ToJSONStructure method converts a list of functions to a JSON structure that can be parsed by a grammar.  
- The Select method returns a list of functions containing the function with the given name.  
- The code uses the JSONFunctionStructure struct to represent the JSON structure of the functions.  
- The Item struct is used to represent an item in the JSON structure.  
- The code uses the defaultFunctionNameKey and defaultFunctionArgumentsKey constants to represent the default keys for the function name and arguments in the JSON structure.  
- The code uses the log package to log errors during the unmarshalling process.  
  
  
  
# pkg/functions/json_mode.go  
Package/Component name: functions  
  
Imports:  
- fmt  
- strings  
- unicode/utf8  
  
External data, input sources:  
- JSONBNF: A string containing the grammar for JSON in Backus-Naur Form (BNF).  
  
TODOs:  
- Add support for more data types, such as dates and times.  
- Implement a parser for the JSONBNF grammar.  
  
Summary of major code parts:  
- JSONBNF: A constant string containing the grammar for JSON in Backus-Naur Form (BNF). This grammar defines the structure of JSON objects, arrays, strings, numbers, and other data types.  
- Functions: The package also contains functions for working with JSON data, such as parsing, encoding, and validating. These functions are not shown in the provided code, but they are implied by the presence of the JSONBNF grammar.  
  
  
  
# pkg/functions/parse.go  
## Package: functions  
  
This package provides functions for handling grammar configurations and parsing function call results.  
  
### External Data and Input Sources  
  
This package does not appear to rely on any external data sources or input sources.  
  
### TODOs  
  
There are no TODO comments in this code.  
  
### Major Code Parts  
  
1. **Grammar Configuration:**  
   - The `GrammarConfig` struct defines the configuration for the grammar, including options for parallel calls, mixed mode, and schema type.  
   - The `FunctionsConfig` struct includes the grammar configuration and additional settings for handling function call results.  
   - The `GrammarOptions()` function returns a list of grammar options based on the provided configuration.  
  
2. **Function Call Result Parsing:**  
   - The `ParseTextContent()` function extracts a specific string from the LLM response based on a provided regex.  
   - The `ParseJSON()` function parses a JSON string that may contain multiple JSON objects and syntax errors.  
   - The `ParseFunctionCall()` function parses the LLM response to extract function call results, including the function name and arguments.  
   - The `ParseFunctionCallArgs()` function extracts the function arguments from the LLM response based on a provided regex.  
  
3. **LLM Result Cleanup:**  
   - The `CleanupLLMResult()` function cleans up the LLM response by replacing specific strings with predefined values.  
   - The `ParseFunctionCall()` function also includes logic for cleaning up the LLM response before parsing the function call results.  
  
4. **Error Handling:**  
   - The `ParseJSON()` function includes error handling for syntax errors and unmarshal type errors during JSON parsing.  
  
5. **Utility Functions:**  
   - The `ParseFunctionCallArgs()` function provides a utility for extracting function arguments from the LLM response.  
  
In summary, this package provides a comprehensive set of functions for handling grammar configurations, parsing function call results, and cleaning up LLM responses. It includes error handling and utility functions to support the core functionality.
